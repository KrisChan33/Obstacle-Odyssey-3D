TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

1. Definitions
   a. "License" refers to the terms and conditions for use, reproduction, and distribution as defined in this document.
   b. "Licensor" refers to the copyright owner or entity authorized by the copyright owner to grant the License.
   c. "You" refers to an individual or legal entity exercising the permissions granted by the License.

2. Grant of Copyright License
   Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants you a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive,
   no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform,
   sublicense, and distribute the Work and any resulting derivative works in both Source and Object forms.

3. Grant of Patent License
   Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants you a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive,
   no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer
   the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed
   by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted.
   If you institute patent litigation against any entity alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work
   constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to you under this License for that Work
   shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

4. Redistribution
   You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or derivative works thereof, in any medium, with or without modifications,
   provided that you meet the following conditions:
   a. You must give any other recipients of the Work or derivative works a copy of this License.
   b. You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files.
   c. You must retain, in the Source form of any derivative works that you distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
      attribution notices from the Source form of the Work.
   d. If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution, you must include a readable copy of the attribution
      notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the derivative works.
      You may add your own attribution notices within derivative works that you distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE
      text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License.

5. Submission of Contributions
   Unless explicitly stated otherwise, any contribution intentionally submitted by you to the Licensor for inclusion in the Work
   shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. However, nothing herein
   shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with the Licensor regarding such
   contributions.

6. Trademarks
   This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
   except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the
   NOTICE file.

7. Disclaimer of Warranty
   Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, the Licensor and Contributors provide the Work on an "AS IS" BASIS,
   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or
   conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for
   determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with your exercise of
   permissions under this License.

8. Limitation of Liability
   In no event and under no legal theory, unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
   liable to you for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising
   as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work, even if such Contributor has been advised of the
   possibility of such damages.
